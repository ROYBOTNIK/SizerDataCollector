# Curated migrations (Stage 4.75)

This migration pack reconstructs only the supported, user-facing database assets. We intentionally exclude TimescaleDB internal objects (e.g., `_timescaledb_internal` tables, internal materialized hypertables, triggers, telemetry jobs, and job IDs) because they are regenerated by TimescaleDB at runtime when we create hypertables, continuous aggregates, and policies. Keeping these objects out of source control avoids brittle job ID drift and keeps migrations idempotent and safe to re-run.
